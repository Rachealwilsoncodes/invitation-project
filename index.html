  <p> You were never the silent batch —
you filled every corridor with echoes,
every classroom with life,
every ordinary day with something unforgettable.

Yes, you made noise…
but that very noise
will now echo inside our hearts forever.

On days when our hearts were heavy,
you didn’t know it —
but your laughter lightened us,
your mischief healed us,
your presence gave us strength.

You were not just students in a register,
you were energy, chaos, joy, and warmth.

As you step into the world beyond these gates,
carry your loud dreams proudly.
And remember —
your teachers will miss the noise
more than the silence.

Once our students,
forever our echo. 💫</p>
